📍 Project Title
AI Booking Assistant for Travel with Crypto Payment

🚀 One-Sentence Elevator Pitch
An AI-powered travel booking assistant that lets you find and confirm trips within budget and pay seamlessly using cryptocurrency like USDC or ETH.

📝 Detailed Project Description
The AI Booking Assistant is designed to make travel planning fast, personalized, and blockchain-friendly.
It allows users to simply type natural language requests like:

“Book me a flight from Bangalore to Mumbai this weekend under ₹5,000 and pay with USDC.”

The backend AI agent:

Understands the intent – Parses the request for trip type, location, date, and budget.

Fetches available options – Integrates with APIs like Booking.com or Skyscanner for flights/hotels.

Confirms with the user – Suggests best matches within budget and requirements.

Processes crypto payments – Supports USDC, ETH, or other supported tokens.

Finalizes booking – Sends the booking confirmation and receipt.

Usage Examples
npm run dev
Open the frontend in your browser, type:

First login with your mail id

The AI will fetch the best options, confirm with you, and complete payment.

Known Issues

This bridges the gap between AI-powered natural language travel planning and Web3 payments.
